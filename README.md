# Pose-Sensor
My first computer vision project using Teachable ML, HTML, JavaScript, and Node.JS and Arduino Nano. It uses a computer vision ML model to determine if the person in view is striking the right pose. If so it activates the green LED, otherwise it activates the red LED. 

Here is a Youtube Video showing what it does:
